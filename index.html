					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
					<h4>H&R Block-Tax Associate</h4>
					<h5>2023-2024</h5>
					<p2>
						During my time at H&R Block as a tax associate, I assessed client needs and responded to
						questions regarding their tax situations.
						I ensured accurate preparation and filing of tax returns while maintaining a high level of
						client confidentiality.
						I was responsible for organizing and reviewing clients' financial records in a timely manner.
						I proficiently operated tax preparation software and provided courteous service at all times.
						I was also tasked with verifying client documents and ensuring that all tax-related information
						matched the records in the system.

					<h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3><br>
					<h4>Kansas City Community Gardens</h4>
					<p2>
						KC Community Gardens has helped communities across the metropolitan area improve nutrition,
						reduce food expenses, and promote locally grown and sustainable foods.
						The reason why I chose this particular place was because I wanted to help perform activities
						that would bring the community together or
						have the most impact on the community in a helpful way.
						Volunteering at KC Community Gardens and helping them with the preparation of events that
						brought the community together and
						introducing those who were not familiar with the importance of gardening and eating healthy,
						helped me with some of my personal goals for my health and lifestyle.
					</p2><br><br>

					<h4>Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) (at UMKC & MCC)</h4>
					<p2>
						During my time with Phi Theta Kappa at UMKC and MCC, I actively engaged in various academic and community service activities.
						I collaborated with fellow members to organize events that promoted academic excellence and leadership development.

					<h2><b>Education Background</b></h2><br> 
					<p2>
						During my junior year of high school, I was selected for the Early College Academy program (ECA)
						which gave me a head start in college while in high school,
						instead of going to my classes in high school, I would take all my classes at Metropolitan
						Community College (MCC).
						I graduated from Southeast High School and at the same time due to ECA, I graduated with an
						Associate degree in arts.
						After graduation, I enrolled in a few classes at Metropolitan Community College where I
						completed an Associate degree in computer science
						before transferring to the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) to pursue a Bachelor's
						degree in computer science.
						I am an active member of PTK at UMKC and volunteer with KC Community Gardens to help my local
						community.
